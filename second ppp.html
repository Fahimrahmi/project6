            <p class="cat">The cats of America are under siege!</p>
            <p class="i">Long gone are the good old days when a cat's biggest worries were mean <br>
            dogs or a bath. Modern cats must confront satanis, online predators, the <br>
            possibility of needing to survive in a post-apocalytic wasteland, and<br>
            countless other threats to their nine lives.
            <p class="i">For over four decades, the American Association of Pstriots have stood at<br> the vanguard of our country's defense by helping to prepare our nation's cat<br>
            owners for the sifficult conversations they dread having with their pets.<br></p>
            Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety <br>
            answers crucial questions such as, "What is the right age to talk to my cat<br>
            about the proper use of fireams?" and "What are the benefits of my cat <br>
            living a lifestyle of abstinence?" and especially "Why does my cat need to<br>
            use the internet? Can't he just play with yarn like cats used to do?" </p>
